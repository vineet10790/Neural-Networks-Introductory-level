# Neural-Networks-Introductory-level
An introduction to neural networks using numpy with an objective to understand feedforward and backpropagation on MNIST dataset.

## Problem Statement

### In this assignment, we will build a complete neural network using Numpy. We will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc. 

We will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

The assignment is divided into the following sections:

Data preparation
Feedforward
Loss computation
Backpropagation
Parameter updates
Model training and predictions
